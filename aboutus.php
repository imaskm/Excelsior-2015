					<p>It gives me immense pleasure to introduce University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) which was established in 2004 in the campus of Kurukshetra University. It was established with a motive ‘MIND TO MARKET’ so as to achieve excellence in the key areas of engineering and to produce talented and committed human resources driven by the spirit of innovation and team work. Presently the institute imparts training in the four key branches of Engineering namely Computer Science Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bio-Technology and Mechanical Engineering. We offer both graduate and post graduate degrees in these branches of Engineering to about 1600 talented students from all parts of India having top ranks in AIEEE. The Institute is accredited by AICTE and ranks third in state of Haryana according the perception of public and admission seekers. 

       The campus provides excellent infrastructure not only to hone the technical skills of the students but also provides ample space for leisure and extra curricular activities. I am quite confident that your visit to our campus and interaction with the students will certainly elicit a good response from you.
I whole heartedly extend a warm invitation to all who are interested innovation and are obsessed with quality.</p>

<p class='text'>The Kurukshetra University was established in 1956 as a unitary residential University
 and its foundation stone was laid by late Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. 
 Located in the holy city of Kurukshetra, land of the historical battle of 'Mahabharata' and
 the great message of Bhagwad Gita, its campus is situated on the western bank of Brahm Sarover 
 (the holy tank) and extends over an area of over 400 acres. Starting with only the Department of Sanskrit,
 it has grown into a multi-faculty University as one of the premier centres for advanced study and research in the region.  </p></div>
